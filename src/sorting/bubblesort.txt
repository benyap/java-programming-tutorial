BUBBLE SORT:
============

Bubble sort sorts a list by comparing each element with its neighbour,
and doing a swap when it is larger than its neighbour. 


INPUT
	list: array of items
	n	: size of list

ALGORITHM
	for i = 0 to n - 1:
		
		swapped = false
			
		for j = 0 to n - 2:
			// Compare adjacent elements
			if list[j] > list[j + 1]:
				swap list[j], list[j + 1]
				swapped = true
		
		// No more swaps 
		if not swapped:
			break
